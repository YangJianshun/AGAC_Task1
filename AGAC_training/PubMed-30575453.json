Here we describe a 35-year-old woman who presented with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia that was associated with a complete lack of lactation after each of her two deliveries. She is a compound heterozygote for loss-of-function variants of PRLR. Her unaffected parents are heterozygotes. These findings are consistent with previous work showing that mice deficient in functional Prlr do not lactate.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":352,"end":370},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":494,"end":510},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":511,"end":519},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":523,"end":527},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":670,"end":673},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":674,"end":681},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"}]}

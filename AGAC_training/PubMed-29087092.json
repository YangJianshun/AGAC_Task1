Filaggrin plays a key role in\nepidermal barrier function by upholding epidermal structure and moisturization. Up to now, around 40 variants of FLG null-mutations\nhave been genotyped among different world populations. FLG null-mutations are present in up to 10% of the\nCaucasian population in Western Europe and North America, with R05X and 2282del4 as the most common null-mutations.\nEpidemiological studies conducted in Europe indicate a latitude dependent distribution of common FLG null-mutations\nwith a decreasing north-south gradient of R501X and 2282del4 mutation frequencies. FLG null-mutation carriers are prone\nto develop unspecific skin symptoms related to atopic and non-atopic skin disorders due to their defect of epidermal\nbarrier function, which allows greater skin penetration of various hazards. Epidemiological studies indicate an association\nof FLG null-mutations with AEDS, whereas results regarding an association of FLG null-mutations with sensitization to\ncommon inhalant allergens and development of rhinitis and asthma are incoherent. A study conducted in Croatia found a\nlow frequency of FLG null-mutations in general population (2.6%) and did not confirm FLG null-mutations as an etiological\nfactor for atopy and atopic disease in the studied population.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":53,"end":67},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":80,"end":96},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":129,"end":132},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":153,"end":159},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":214,"end":247},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":839,"end":842},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":843,"end":856},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":879,"end":886},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":887,"end":911},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1105,"end":1116},"obj":"Interaction"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1123},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1138},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1144,"end":1148},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"}]}

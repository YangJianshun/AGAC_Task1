The prevalence of ERBB2/HER2 mutation in bone metastasis of breast cancer and the associated phenotype are not known. In this study, bone metastases from breast cancer patients (n\u2009=\u2009231) were analyzed for ERBB2/HER2 mutation. In 7 patients (3%; median age 70\u00a0years, range 50-83\u00a0years), gain-of-function mutations of ERBB2/HER2 were detected. The most frequent mutation was p.L755S (71%). In 29% of mutated cases, p.V777L was found. Lobular breast cancer was present in 71% of mutated cases (n\u2009=\u20095) and in 49% of all samples (n\u2009=\u2009231; p\u2009=\u20090.275). Mutation frequency was 4.4% in the lobular subgroup and 17.4% in the pleomorphic subtype of lobular cancer (n\u2009=\u200923), respectively. All but one mutated lobular cancers were of the pleomorphic subtype (p\u2009=\u20090.006). Mutated cancers belonged either to the luminal (n\u2009=\u20094) or to the triple-negative types (n\u2009=\u20093). With regard to protein expression and gene amplification, HER2 was negative in all mutated cases. Among the 14% of metastatic luminal cancers with estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) mutation, conveying resistance against aromatase inhibitors, no concomitant ERBB2/HER2 mutation occurred. We conclude that activating HER2 mutation is present in about 3% of bone metastases from breast cancers, with significantly higher rates in the pleomorphic subtype of lobular cancer. Since mutated cases appear to be HER2-negative by conventional testing, the opportunity for specific anti-HER2 therapy may be missed.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":142,"end":157},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":219,"end":224},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":245,"end":253},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":272,"end":289},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":293,"end":306},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1462,"end":1472},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1473,"end":1477},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1478,"end":1486},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1513,"end":1528},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1534,"end":1548},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1569,"end":1581},"obj":"PosReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}

Here we describe how deficiency of CYBC1, a previously uncharacterized protein in humans (C17orf62), leads to reduced expression of NADPH oxidase's main subunit (gp91phox) and results in CGD. Analyzing two brothers diagnosed with CGD we identify a homozygous loss-of-function mutation, p.Tyr2Ter, in CYBC1. Imputation of p.Tyr2Ter into 155K chip-genotyped Icelanders reveals six additional homozygotes, all with signs of CGD, manifesting as colitis, rare infections, or a severely impaired PMA-induced neutrophil oxidative burst. Homozygosity for p.Tyr2Ter consequently associates with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Iceland (P\u2009=\u20098.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8; OR\u2009=\u200967.6), as well as reduced height (P\u2009=\u20093.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; -8.5\u2009cm). Overall, we find that CYBC1 deficiency results in CGD characterized by colitis and a distinct profile of infections indicative of macrophage dysfunction.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":29},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":30,"end":38},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":50,"end":55},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":67,"end":73},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":74,"end":103},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":105,"end":114},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":118,"end":180},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":199,"end":204},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":205,"end":234},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":298,"end":308},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":312,"end":317},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":387,"end":394},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":395,"end":437},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":453,"end":460},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":464,"end":467},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"something","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"}]}

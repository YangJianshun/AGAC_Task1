To determine genotype-phenotype correlation and functional analysis of mutant GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, 13 Brazilian patients clinically and biochemical diagnosed for MLII or III alpha/beta were studied. By sequencing of genomic GNPTAB of the MLII and MLIII alpha/beta patients we identified six novel mutations: p.D76G, p.S385L, p.Q278Kfs*3, p.H588Qfs*27, p.N642Lfs*10 and p.Y1111*. Expression analysis by western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the mutant \u03b1\u2044\u03b2-subunit precursor p.D76G is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the mutant p.S385L is correctly transported to the cis-Golgi apparatus and proteolytically processed. Both mutations lead to complete loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity, consistent with the severe clinical MLII phenotype of the patients. Our study expands the genotypic spectrum of MLII and provides novel insights into structural requirements to ensure GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":543,"end":549},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":627,"end":633},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":635,"end":642},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":644,"end":655},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":657,"end":669},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":671,"end":683},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":688,"end":696},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":819,"end":825},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":886,"end":893},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1009,"end":1013},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1044},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1053},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"}]}

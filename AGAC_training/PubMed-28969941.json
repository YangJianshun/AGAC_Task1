The chemokine receptor CCR5 play an important role in disease pathogenesis, contributing to pro-inflammatory response and osteoclastogenesis. CCR5\u039432 (rs333) is a loss-of-function mutation in the CCR5 gene, which can potentially modulate the host response and, consequently periodontitis outcome. Thus, we investigated the effect of the CCR5\u039432 mutation over the risk to suffer periodontitis in a cohort of Brazilian patients (total N=699), representative of disease susceptibility (chronic periodontitis, N=197; and aggressive periodontitis, N=91) or resistance (chronic gingivitis, N=193) phenotypes, and healthy subjects (N=218). Additionally, we assayed the influence of CCR5\u039432 in the expression of the biomarkers TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and T-bet, and key periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola. In the association analysis of resistant versus susceptible subjects, CCR5\u039432 mutant allele-carriers proved significantly protected against chronic (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29-0.83; p-value 0.01) and aggressive (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.22-0.94; p-value 0.03) periodontitis. Further, heterozygous subjects exhibited significantly decreased expression of TNF\u03b1 in periodontal tissues, pointing to a functional effect of the mutation in periodontal tissues during the progression of the disease. Conversely, no significant changes were observed in the presence or quantity of the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in the subgingival biofilm that could be attributable to the mutant genotype.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":564,"end":569},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":576,"end":592},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":609,"end":613},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":642,"end":650},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":655,"end":668},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1569,"end":1578},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1579,"end":1589},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1593,"end":1597},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1661,"end":1669},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"}]}

Here, we describe two individuals, each with homozygous missense variants in ATP5F1D, who presented with episodic lethargy, metabolic acidosis, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, and hyperammonemia. Subject 1, homozygous for c.245C\u003ET (p.Pro82Leu), presented with recurrent metabolic decompensation starting in the neonatal period, and subject 2, homozygous for c.317T\u003EG (p.Val106Gly), presented with acute encephalopathy in childhood. Cultured skin fibroblasts from these individuals exhibited impaired assembly of F1FO ATP synthase and subsequent reduced complex V activity. Cells from subject 1 also exhibited a significant decrease in mitochondrial cristae. Knockdown of Drosophila ATPsyn\u03b4, the ATP5F1D homolog, in developing eyes and brains caused a near complete loss of the fly head, a phenotype that was fully rescued by wild-type human ATP5F1D. In contrast, expression of the ATP5F1D c.245C\u003ET and c.317T\u003EG variants rescued the head-size phenotype but recapitulated the eye and antennae defects seen in other genetic models of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. Our\u00a0data establish c.245C\u003ET (p.Pro82Leu) and c.317T\u003EG (p.Val106Gly) in ATP5F1D as pathogenic variants leading to a Mendelian mitochondrial disease featuring episodic metabolic decompensation.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":0,"end":19},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":30},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":73,"end":78},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":81,"end":99},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":374,"end":391},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":395,"end":402},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":408,"end":417},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":423,"end":440},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":442,"end":460},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":462,"end":489},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":495,"end":509},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1226,"end":1234},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1235,"end":1242},"obj":"GOF"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1247,"end":1266},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1271,"end":1284},"obj":"LOF"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1292},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1297,"end":1313},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1491,"end":1499},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1500,"end":1510},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1513,"end":1544},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T20"}]}

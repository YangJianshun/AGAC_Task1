Whole genome sequencing identified om40 as an allele of hsp-90, previously known as daf-21, which encodes the C. elegans ortholog of the cytosolic form of HSP90. This protein is a molecular chaperone with a central position in the protein homeostasis network, which is responsible for proper folding, structural maintenance, and degradation of proteins. In addition to its essential role in cellular function, HSP90 plays an important role in stem cell maintenance and renewal. Complementation analysis using a deletion allele of hsp-90 confirmed that ego-3 is the same gene. hsp-90(om40) is an I\u2192N conservative missense mutation of a highly conserved residue in the middle domain of HSP-90 RNA interference-mediated knockdown of hsp-90 expression partially phenocopied hsp-90(om40), confirming the loss-of-function nature of hsp-90(om40) Furthermore, reduced HSP-90 activity enhanced the effect of reduced function of both the GLP-1 receptor and the downstream LAG-1 transcription factor. Taken together, our results provide the first experimental evidence of an essential role for HSP90 in Notch signaling in development.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":282,"end":287},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":288,"end":292},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":294,"end":300},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":309,"end":316},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":357,"end":366},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":394,"end":403},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":405,"end":426},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":455,"end":495},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T4"}]}

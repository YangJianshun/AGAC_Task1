The aim of the project was to study effects of HtpG on the selected virulence factors responsible for pathogenesis and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa.\nMETHODOLOGY: By characterizing a htpG null mutant of P. aeruginosa, we have identified the role of HtpG in the production of selected factors.\nRESULTS: We showed that \u0394htpG mutant affects many physiological processes containing: decreased activity of the LasA protease, reduction of biofilm formation, decreased motility, and diminished amount of rhamnolipids and pyoverdine/pyocyanin. These defects were most evident when the \u0394htpG strain was cultured at 42\u00b0C.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the unexplored role of HtpG in the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa, and indicate potential targets for antibacterial therapeutics.

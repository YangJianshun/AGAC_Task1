More than 25 different CLCN7 mutations have been identified in patients affected with Albers-Sch\u00f6nberg disease, but only one mutation (Clcn7G213R) has been introduced in mice to create an animal model of this disease. Here we describe a mouse with a different osteopetrosis-causing mutation (Clcn7F318L). Compared to Clcn7+/+ mice, 12-week-old Clcn7F318L/+ mice have significantly increased trabecular bone volume, consistent with Clcn7F318L acting as a dominant negative mutation. Clcn7F318L/F318L and Clcn7F318L/G213R mice die by 1month of age and resemble Clcn7 knockout mice, which indicate that p.F318L mutant protein is non-functional and p.F318L and p.G213R mutant proteins do not complement one another. Since it has been reported that treatment with interferon gamma (IFN-G) improves bone properties in Clcn7G213R/+ mice, we treated Clcn7F318L/+ mice with IFN-G and observed a decrease in osteoclast number and mineral apposition rate, but no overall improvement in bone properties. Our results suggest that the benefits of IFN-G therapy in patients with Albers-Sch\u00f6nberg disease may be mutation-specific.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":72,"end":80},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":81,"end":90},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":94,"end":99},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":200,"end":224},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":663,"end":672},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":673,"end":695},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":713,"end":718},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":718,"end":723},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":745,"end":753},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":882,"end":889},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":897,"end":904},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":908,"end":911},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":912,"end":922},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"}]}

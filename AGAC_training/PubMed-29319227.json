FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEINS (FLNs) are phosphofructokinase-B (PfkB)-type carbohydrate kinases that act as part of the PEP complex; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying FLN activity in rice remain elusive. Previously, we identified and characterized a heat-stress sensitive albino (hsa1) mutant in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that HSA1 encodes a putative OsFLN2. Here, we further demonstrated that knockdown or knockout of the OsFLN1, a close homolog of HSA1/OsFLN2, considerably inhibits chloroplast biogenesis and the fln1 knockout mutants, created by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associate protein 9, exhibit severe albino phenotype and seedling lethality. Moreover, OsFLN1 localizes to the chloroplast. Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments revealed that OsFLN1 and HSA1/OsFLN2 interact with THIOREDOXINZ (OsTRXz) to regulate chloroplast development. In agreement with this, knockout of OsTRXz resulted in a similar albino and seedling lethality phenotype to that of the fln1 mutants. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis revealed that the transcription and translation of PEP-dependent genes were strongly inhibited in fln1 and trxz mutants, indicating that loss of OsFLN1, HSA1/OsFLN2, or OsTRXz function perturbs the stability of the transcriptionally active chromosome complex and PEP activity. These results show that OsFLN1 and HSA1/OsFLN2 contribute to chloroplast biogenesis and plant growth.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1405,"end":1418},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1423,"end":1434},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1438,"end":1457},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1472,"end":1481},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1485,"end":1489},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1499,"end":1506},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1572,"end":1580},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1585,"end":1645},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1650,"end":1653},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1654,"end":1662},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T8"}]}

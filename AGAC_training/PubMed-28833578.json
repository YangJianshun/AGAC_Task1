Pearson's chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the two groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 867 MM biopsies and 9965 general population controls were genotyped, respectively. In the MM sample 2 (0.23%) individuals were homozygous and 80 (9.4%) heterozygous mutation carriers. In the general population controls the prevalence of FLG mutations was 18 (0.18%) and 835 (8.4%) for homozygous and heterozygous mutations, respectively. Fisher's exact test and Pearson's chi square test yielded non-significant p-values when the groups were compared.\nCONCLUSION: FLG mutation was not associated with MM in the studied populations. This finding indicates that epidermal deficiency of filaggrin and its degradation products do not influence the risk of MM significantly. This article is protected by copyright.

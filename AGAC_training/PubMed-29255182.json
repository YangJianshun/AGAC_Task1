Disruptions in cilia structure or function lead to a class of human disorders called ciliopathies. Joubert syndrome is characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms, including a variable degree of intellectual disability, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities. Here we report a novel homozygous missense variant c.[223G\u003EA] (p.(Gly75Arg) in the ARL13B gene, which was identified by whole-exome sequencing of a trio from a consanguineous family with multiple-affected individuals suffering from intellectual disability, ataxia, ocular defects, and epilepsy. The same variant was also identified in a second family. We saw a striking difference in the severity of ataxia between affected male and female individuals in both families. Both ARL13B and ARL13B-c.[223G\u003EA] (p.(Gly75Arg) expression rescued the cilia length and Shh defects displayed by Arl13b hennin (null) cells, indicating that the variant did not disrupt either ARL13B function. In contrast, ARL13B-c.[223G\u003EA] (p.(Gly75Arg) displayed a marked loss of ARL3 guanine nucleotide-exchange factor activity, with retention of its GTPase activities, highlighting the correlation between its loss of function as an ARL3 guanine nucleotide-exchange factor and Joubert syndrome.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":19,"end":25},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":26,"end":33},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":68,"end":75},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":80,"end":123},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1223},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1234},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1268,"end":1272},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1276,"end":1324},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1475,"end":1491},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"}]}

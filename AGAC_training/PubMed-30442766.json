Knockdown of the Drosophila LZTR1 ortholog CG3711 resulted in a Ras-dependent gain-of-function phenotype. Endogenous human LZTR1 associates with the main RAS isoforms. Inactivation of LZTR1 led to decreased ubiquitination and enhanced plasma membrane localization of endogenous KRAS (V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog). We propose that LZTR1 acts as a conserved regulator of RAS ubiquitination and MAPK pathway activation. Because LZTR1 disease mutations failed to revert loss-of-function phenotypes, our findings provide a molecular rationale for LZTR1 involvement in a variety of inherited and acquired human disorders.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":162,"end":174},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":216,"end":269},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":282,"end":290},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":291,"end":338},"obj":"Pathway"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":339,"end":347},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":352,"end":359},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":360,"end":401},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":571,"end":583},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":587,"end":592},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":600,"end":609},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":610,"end":624},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":629,"end":637},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":638,"end":685},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T8"}]}

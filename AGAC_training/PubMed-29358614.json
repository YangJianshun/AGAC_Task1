Here, we identify a patient with Nance-Horan syndrome caused by a new nonsense NHS variant. In addition, the patient presented congenital diaphragmatic hernia. NHS gene expression in murine fetal diaphragm was demonstrated, suggesting a possible involvement of NHS in diaphragm development. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia could result from NHS loss of function in pleuroperitoneal fold or in somites-derived muscle progenitor cells leading to an impairment of their cells migration.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":278,"end":298},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":299,"end":308},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":315,"end":323},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":324,"end":327},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":372,"end":403},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":536,"end":567},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":574,"end":585},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":586,"end":589},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":590,"end":606},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":712,"end":727},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"}]}

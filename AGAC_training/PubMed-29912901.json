Here we report that germline loss of function mutations in TRIM28 predispose children to Wilms tumour. Loss of function of this transcriptional co-repressor, which has a role in nephrogenesis, has not previously been associated with cancer. Inactivation of TRIM28, either germline or somatic, occurred through inactivating mutations, loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing. TRIM28-mutated tumours had a monomorphic epithelial histology that is uncommon for Wilms tumour. Critically, these tumours were negative for TRIM28 immunohistochemical staining whereas the epithelial component in normal tissue and other Wilms tumours stained positively. These data, together with a characteristic gene expression profile, suggest that inactivation of TRIM28 provides the molecular basis for defining a previously described subtype of Wilms tumour, that has early age of onset and excellent prognosis.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":301,"end":317},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":318,"end":327},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":331,"end":337},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":361,"end":373},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":513,"end":525},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":529,"end":535},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":582,"end":604},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":606,"end":628},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":632,"end":652},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"}]}

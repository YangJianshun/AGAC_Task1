Mind Bomb is an essential E3 ligase during Notch pathway signaling in insects and vertebrates. While Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a Mind Bomb homolog (mib-1), it has never been recovered in the extensive Notch suppressor/enhancer screens that have identified numerous pathway components. Here, we show that C. elegans mib-1 null mutants have a spermatogenesis-defective phenotype that results in a heterogeneous mixture of arrested spermatocytes, defective spermatids, and motility-impaired spermatozoa. mib-1 mutants also have chromosome segregation defects during meiosis, molecular null mutants are intrinsically temperature-sensitive, and many mib-1 spermatids contain large amounts of tubulin. These phenotypic features are similar to the endogenous RNA intereference (RNAi) mutants, but mib-1 mutants do not affect RNAi. MIB-1 protein is expressed throughout the germ line with peak expression in spermatocytes followed by segregation into the residual body during spermatid formation. C. elegans mib-1 expression, while upregulated during spermatogenesis, also occurs somatically, including in vulva precursor cells. Here, we show that mib-1 mutants suppress both lin-12 and glp-1 (C. elegans Notch) gain-of-function mutants, restoring anchor cell formation and a functional vulva to the former and partly restoring oocyte production to the latter. However, suppressed hermaphrodites are only observed when grown at 25\u00b0, and they are self-sterile. This probably explains why mib-1 was not previously recovered as a Notch pathway component in suppressor/enhancer selection experiments.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":639,"end":644},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":650,"end":657},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":665,"end":700},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":706,"end":716},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":719,"end":766},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1464,"end":1469},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1470,"end":1477},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1478,"end":1486},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1492,"end":1498},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1508},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1528,"end":1544},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1545,"end":1552},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1554,"end":1563},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1564,"end":1585},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1592,"end":1608},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1644,"end":1661},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T8"}]}

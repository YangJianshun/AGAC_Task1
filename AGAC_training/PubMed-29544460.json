One of the best characterized is the McCune Albright syndrome. The disease presents with an increased incidence of neoplasias in specific tissues.\nMAIN BODY: A similar repertoire of neoplasms can develop whether mutations occur spontaneously in somatic tissues during fetal development or after birth. Glands are the most \"permissive\" tissues, recently found to include the entire gastrointestinal tract. High frequency of activating G\u03b1s mutations is associated with precise diagnoses (e.g., IPMN, Pyloric gland adenoma, pituitary toxic adenoma). Typically, most neoplastic lesions, from thyroid to pancreas, remain well differentiated but may be a precursor to aggressive cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: Here we propose the possibility that gain-of-function mutations of G\u03b1s interfere with signals in the microenvironment of permissive tissues and lead to a transversal neoplastic phenotype.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":67,"end":76},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":77,"end":87},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":105,"end":130},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":251,"end":275},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":637,"end":647},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":648,"end":651},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":652,"end":661},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":706,"end":710},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":712,"end":733},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":735,"end":758},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":945,"end":961},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":962,"end":971},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":975,"end":978},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":979,"end":988},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1009,"end":1039},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1052,"end":1059},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1062,"end":1094},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}

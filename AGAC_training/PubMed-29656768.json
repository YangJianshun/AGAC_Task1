To identify rare genetic factors other than apolipoprotein E \u025b4 allele (ApoE \u025b4) contributing to the pathogenesis of late-onset AD (LOAD), we conducted a whole-exome analysis of 246 ApoE \u025b4-negative LOAD cases and 172 matched controls in Hong Kong Chinese population. LOAD patients showed a significantly higher burden of rare loss-of-function variants in genes related to immune function than healthy controls. Among the genes involved in immune function, we identified a rare stop-gain variant (p.Q48X) in mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL) gene present exclusively in 6 LOAD cases. MLKL is expressed in neurons, and the its expression levels in the p.Q48X carriers were significantly lower than that in age-matched wild-type controls. The ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 significantly increased in MLKL knockdown cells compared to scramble controls. MLKL loss-of-function mutation might contribute to late-onset ApoE \u025b4-negative AD in the Hong Kong Chinese population.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":7,"end":14},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":18,"end":22},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":31,"end":45},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":66,"end":85},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":810,"end":814},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":852,"end":869},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":877,"end":883},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":912,"end":917},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1072},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1073,"end":1089},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1098},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1147,"end":1149},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"}]}

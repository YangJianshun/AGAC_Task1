Here, we have studied four affected people in three families presenting with cholestasis, congenital diarrhea, impaired hearing, and bone fragility. Whole-exome sequencing of all affected individuals and their parents identified biallelic mutations in Unc-45 Myosin Chaperone A (UNC45A) as a likely driver for this disorder. Subsequent in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo functional studies of the candidate gene indicated a loss-of-function paradigm, wherein mutations attenuated or abolished protein activity with concomitant defects in gut development and function.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":16},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":26},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":30,"end":36},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":45,"end":53},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":66,"end":77},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":79,"end":87},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":89,"end":105},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":111,"end":125},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":348,"end":359},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":361,"end":380},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":382,"end":398},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":404,"end":418},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":500,"end":519},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":550,"end":556},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":681,"end":697},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":726,"end":736},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":740,"end":749},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":750,"end":757},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":758,"end":766},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":784,"end":791},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":795,"end":810},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R19","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R20","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T15"}]}

The adaptive telomere failure hypothesis suggests that certain environmental stresses can induce a low level of telomere failure, potentially leading to elevated subtelomeric recombination that could result in adaptive mutational changes within subtelomeric genes. Here, we tested a key prediction of the adaptive telomere failure hypothesis-that telomere dysfunction mild enough to have little or no overall effect on cell fitness could still lead to substantial increases in the mutation rates of subtelomeric genes. Our results show that a mutant of Kluyveromyces lactis with stably short telomeres produced a large increase in the frequency of mutations affecting the native subtelomeric \u03b2-galactosidase (LAC4) gene. All lac4 mutants examined from strains with severe telomere dysfunction underwent terminal deletion/duplication events consistent with being due to break-induced replication. In contrast, although cells with mild telomere dysfunction also exhibited similar terminal deletion and duplication events, up to 50% of lac4 mutants from this background unexpectedly contained base changes within the LAC4 coding region. This mutational bias for producing base changes demonstrates that mild telomere dysfunction can be well suited as a force for altering the adaptive potential of subtelomeric genes.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1010},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1011,"end":1018},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1074,"end":1083},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1113},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1314,"end":1318},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1319,"end":1326},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1361,"end":1370},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1371,"end":1383},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"}]}

Whole exome sequencing identified deleterious variants in key apoptotic genes in two families with recurrent neural tube defects. Functional studies in fibroblasts indicate that these variants are loss-of-function, as apoptosis is significantly reduced. This is the first report of variants in apoptotic genes contributing to neural tube defect risk in humans.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":4,"end":19},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":20,"end":25},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":30,"end":35},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":540,"end":548},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":553,"end":569},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":574,"end":583},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":601,"end":608},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":638,"end":646},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":650,"end":665},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":666,"end":678},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":682,"end":700},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"}]}

Although a few genes related to other productive traits have been characterized, the molecular genetic basis of fiber growth control in camelids is still poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) is a secreted signaling protein that controls hair growth in humans and other mammals. Mutations in the FGF5 gene have been associated with long-hair phenotypes in several species. Here, we sequenced the llama FGF5 gene, which consists of three exons encoding 813\u00a0bp. cDNA analysis from hair follicles revealed the expression of two FGF5 alternative spliced transcripts, in one of which exon 2 is absent. DNA variation analysis showed four polymorphisms in the coding region: a synonymous SNP (c.210A\u003EG), a single base deletion (c.348delA), a 12-bp insertion (c.351_352insCATATAACATAG) and a non-sense mutation (c.499C\u003ET). The deletion was always found together with the insertion forming a haplotype and producing a putative truncated protein of 123 amino acids. The c.499C\u003ET mutation also leads to a premature stop codon at position 168. In both cases, critical functional domains of FGF5, including one heparin binding site, are lost. All animals analyzed were homozygous for one of the deleterious mutations or compound heterozygous for both (i.e. c.348delA, c.351_352insCATATAACATAG/c.499T). Sequencing of guanaco samples showed that the FGF5 gene encodes a full-length 270-amino acid protein. These results suggest that FGF5 is likely functional in short-haired wild species and non-functional in the domestic fiber-producing species, the llama.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":936,"end":945},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1175,"end":1183},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1289},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1293,"end":1297},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1313,"end":1333},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1343},"obj":"NegReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T3"}]}

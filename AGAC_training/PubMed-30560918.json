Mutations in RIG-I (C268F and E373A) lead to impaired ATPase activity, thereby driving hyperactive signaling associated with autoimmune diseases. Here we report, using hydrogen/deuterium exchange, mechanistic models for dysregulated RIG-I proofreading that ultimately result in the improper recognition of cellular RNAs bearing 7-methylguanosine and N1-2'-O-methylation (Cap1) on the 5' end. Cap1-RNA compromises its ability to stabilize RIG-I helicase and blunts caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD) partial opening by threefold. RIG-I H830A mutation restores Cap1-helicase engagement as well as CARDs partial opening event to a level comparable to that of 5'ppp. However, E373A RIG-I locks the receptor in an ATP-bound state, resulting in enhanced Cap1-helicase engagement and a sequential CARDs stimulation. C268F mutation renders a more tethered ring architecture and results in constitutive CARDs signaling in an ATP-independent manner.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":260,"end":265},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":267,"end":272},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":277,"end":282},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":292,"end":300},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":301,"end":307},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":308,"end":316},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":334,"end":345},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":346,"end":355},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":791,"end":796},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":797,"end":811},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":812,"end":820},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":821,"end":834},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":835,"end":845},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":857,"end":884},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":934,"end":939},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":940,"end":945},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1001,"end":1009},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1023},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1034},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1069},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1071,"end":1085},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1096,"end":1100},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1101,"end":1127},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1142},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1171},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T26"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R18","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R19","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T27"},{"id":"R20","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R21","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T25","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R22","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T27","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"}]}

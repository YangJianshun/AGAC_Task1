In the Solanaceae, Plantaginaceae and Rosaceae gametophytic SI is controlled by the pistil-specific S-RNases and the pollen S-locus F-box proteins but non-S-specific factors, namely modifiers, are also required. In apricot, Prunus armeniaca (Rosaceae), we previously mapped two pollen-part mutations that confer self-compatibility in cultivars Canino and Katy at the distal end of chromosome 3 (M-locus) unlinked to the S-locus. Here, we used high-resolution mapping to identify the M-locus with an ~134 kb segment containing ParM-1-16 genes. Gene expression analysis identified four genes preferentially expressed in anthers as modifier gene candidates, ParM-6, -7, -9 and -14. Variant calling of WGS Illumina data from Canino, Katy, and 10 self-incompatible cultivars detected a 358 bp miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) insertion in ParM-7 shared only by self-compatible apricots, supporting ParM-7 as strong candidate gene required for SI. ParM-7 encodes a disulfide bond A-like oxidoreductase protein, which we named ParMDO. The MITE insertion truncates the ParMDO ORF and produces a loss of SI function, suggesting that pollen rejection in Prunus is dependent on redox regulation. Based on phylogentic analyses we also suggest that ParMDO may have originated from a tandem duplication followed by subfunctionalization and pollen-specific expression.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":541,"end":550},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":556,"end":562},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":563,"end":581},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1304,"end":1308},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1309,"end":1318},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1319,"end":1328},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1333,"end":1343},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1359,"end":1363},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1367,"end":1378},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"}]}

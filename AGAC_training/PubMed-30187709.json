Evaluation of underlying etiology is important in managing young bronchiectasis patients with recurrent infections caused by unusual pathogens. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) protein plays a key role in STAT signaling and immune system regulation. Heterozygotes for gain-of-function (GOF) alleles of the STAT1 gene usually display autosomal dominant chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) and a wide range of clinical features, such as bronchiectasis. Here, we report on a patient with CMC and bronchiectasis with various types of infections who carried a pathogenic variant of the STAT1 gene. The 24-year-old female presented with recurrent respiratory bacterial and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections complicated by severe bronchiectasis and CMC. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a c.800C\u003ET (p.Ala267Val) heterozygous mutation in the STAT1 gene. Further analysis by Sanger sequencing of STAT1 from the patient and her parents revealed the patient had a de novo occurrence of the variant. This is the first report of a Korean patient with a GOF pathogenic variant in STAT1. Physicians should be aware of the existence of this variant as a genetic factor associated with CMC and bronchiectasis complicated by recurrent infection.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":0,"end":14},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":19,"end":51},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":67,"end":72},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":73,"end":89},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":90,"end":97},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":552,"end":568},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":575,"end":582},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":590,"end":595},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":617,"end":669},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":723,"end":737},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":929,"end":994},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1031},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1036,"end":1039},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1064,"end":1072},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1075,"end":1083},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1127,"end":1132},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"}]}

Previous studies have demonstrated that genetic defects play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CHD. However, the genetic basis of CHD remains poorly understood due to substantial genetic heterogeneity. In this study, the coding exons and splicing boundaries of the NR2F2 gene, which encodes a pleiotropic transcription factor required for normal cardiovascular development, were sequenced in 168 unrelated patients with CHD, and a novel mutation (c.247G\u00a0\u003E\u00a0T, equivalent to p.G83X) was detected in a patient with double outlet right ventricle as well as ventricular septal defect. Genetic scanning of the mutation carrier's relatives available showed that the mutation was present in all affected family members but absent in unaffected family members. Analysis of the index patient's pedigree displayed that the mutation co-segregated with CHD, which was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance. The nonsense mutation was absent in 230 unrelated, ethnically-matched healthy individuals used as controls. Functional deciphers by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system revealed that the mutant NR2F2 protein had no transcriptional activity as compared with its wild-type counterpart. Furthermore, the mutation abrogated the synergistic transcriptional activation between NR2F2 and GATA4, another core cardiac transcription factor associated with CHD. This study firstly associates NR2F2 loss-of-function mutation with an increased susceptibility to double outlet right ventricle in humans, which provides further significant insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning CHD, suggesting potential implications for genetic counseling of CHD families and personalized treatment of CHD patients.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":8,"end":13},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":30},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":31,"end":39},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":55,"end":78},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1345},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1346,"end":1351},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1366},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1367,"end":1391},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1453,"end":1461},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1462,"end":1471},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1476,"end":1514},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1523,"end":1528},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1533,"end":1538},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"}]}

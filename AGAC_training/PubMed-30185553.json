Altered Ca2+ homeostasis has been consistently observed in neurological diseases. How Ca2+ homeostasis is achieved in various cellular compartments of disease-relevant cell types is not well understood. Here we show in Drosophila Parkinson's disease (PD) models that Ca2+ transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria through the ER-mitochondria contact site (ERMCS) critically regulates mitochondrial Ca2+ (mito-Ca2+) homeostasis in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and that the PD-associated PINK1 protein modulates this process. In PINK1 mutant DA neurons, the ERMCS is strengthened and mito-Ca2+ level is elevated, resulting in mitochondrial enlargement and neuronal death. Miro, a well-characterized component of the mitochondrial trafficking machinery, mediates the effects of PINK1 on mito-Ca2+ and mitochondrial morphology, apparently in a transport-independent manner. Miro overexpression mimics PINK1 loss-of-function effect, whereas inhibition of Miro or components of the ERMCS, or pharmacological modulation of ERMCS function, rescued PINK1 mutant phenotypes. Mito-Ca2+ homeostasis is also altered in the LRRK2-G2019S model of PD and the PAR-1/MARK model of neurodegeneration, and genetic or pharmacological restoration of mito-Ca2+ level is beneficial in these models. Our results highlight the importance of mito-Ca2+ homeostasis maintained by Miro and the ERMCS to mitochondrial physiology and neuronal integrity. Targeting this mito-Ca2+ homeostasis pathway holds promise for a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":758,"end":763},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":764,"end":770},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":787,"end":792},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":796,"end":808},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":813,"end":828},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":832,"end":840},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":855,"end":868},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":869,"end":880},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":885,"end":893},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":894,"end":899},"obj":"NegReg"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T10"}]}

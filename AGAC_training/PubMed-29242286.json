In Caenorhabditis elegans, either one of two presenilin genes (sel-12 or hop-1) facilitate Notch activation, providing the catalytic subunit for the \u03b3 secretase proteolytic enzyme complex. For all known Notch signaling events, sel-12 can mediate Notch activation, so the conservation of hop-1 remains a mystery. Here, we uncover a novel \"late-onset\" germline Notch phenotype in which HOP-1-deficient worms fail to maintain proliferating germline stem cells during adulthood. Either SEL-12 or HOP-1 presenilin can impart sufficient Notch signaling for the establishment and expansion of the germline, but maintenance of an adult stem cell pool relies exclusively on HOP-1-mediated Notch signaling. We also show that HOP-1 is necessary for maximum fecundity and reproductive span. The low-fecundity phenotype of hop-1 mutants can be phenocopied by switching off glp-1/Notch function during the last stage of larval development. We propose that at the end of larval development, dual presenilin usage switches exclusively to HOP-1, perhaps offering opportunities for differential regulation of the germline during adulthood. Additional defects in oocyte size and production rate in hop-1 and glp-1 mutants indicate that the process of oogenesis is compromised when germline Notch signaling is switched off. We calculate that in wild-type adults, as much as 86% of cells derived from the stem cell pool function to support oogenesis. This work suggests that an important role for Notch signaling in the adult germline is to furnish a large and continuous supply of nurse cells to support the efficiency of oogenesis.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1073,"end":1076},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1077,"end":1086},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1100,"end":1105},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1113},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1136,"end":1149},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1150,"end":1170},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1423,"end":1430},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1434,"end":1445},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1450,"end":1460},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1469,"end":1474},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1479,"end":1484},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1485,"end":1492},"obj":"Var"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T12"}]}

A mutation analysis of 24 patients with CMML revealed the relationship of GC effectiveness, defined as a monocyte reduction of\u2009\u003E\u200950% within 3\u00a0days of methylprednisolone administration, with the MEFV single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and CBL mutation. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes harboring MEFV E148Q produced greater amounts of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 than did wild-type monocytes; this was effectively suppressed by GC. Primary CMML cells harboring the MEFV SNV and CBL mutation, and the myelomonocytic leukemia cell line GDM-1, harboring the CBL mutation, were both more significantly suppressed than non-mutated cells following GC treatment in the presence of GM-CSF. A loss-of-function CBL mutation prolonged STAT5 phosphorylation after GM-CSF stimulation, which was rapidly terminated in both patient samples and GDM-1 cells. In conclusion, GC therapy effectively treats CMML cells harboring the MEFV SNV and CBL mutation by reducing inflammatory cytokine production and terminating prolonged STAT5 phosphorylation in the GM-CSF signaling pathway.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":4,"end":12},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":17,"end":21},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":22,"end":47},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":84,"end":89},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":90,"end":99},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":140,"end":171},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1020},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1021,"end":1024},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1025,"end":1033},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1034,"end":1043},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1044,"end":1065},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"}]}

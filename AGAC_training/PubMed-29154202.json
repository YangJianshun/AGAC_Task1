Selected functional polymorphisms in inflammasome genes are evaluated in a cohort of asthmatic children and their families. Gain-of-function NLRP1 variants rs11651270, rs12150220 and rs2670660 resulted significantly associated to asthma in trios (TDT) analysis; and rs11651270 and rs2670660 also with asthma severity and total IgE level in asthmatic children. NLRP1 activators in humans are still unknown, however we hypothesized that individuals with gain-of-function SNPs in NLRP1 could be more prone in activating inflammasome in the presence of asthma-related cell stressors (i.e. ER stress or ROS), and this activation contribute to exacerbate inflammatory response and asthma development. Gain-of-function IL1A rs17561 resulted significantly associated with a reduced pulmonary capacity in asthmatic children. IL18 rs5744256 which lead to lower serum level of IL-18 appeared to be associated to a worse response to bronchodilators. Concluding, this work provides evidences about the contribution of inflammasome genetics in the development of paediatric asthma, both considering its inflammatory role in alveolar macrophages (i.e.: NLRP1) or its homeostatic role in lung epithelial cells (i.e.: IL1A, IL18).","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":418,"end":434},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":435,"end":440},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":441,"end":449},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":450,"end":460},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":462,"end":472},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":477,"end":486},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":524,"end":530},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":560,"end":570},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":575,"end":584},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":590,"end":594},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":595,"end":601},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":621,"end":630},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":746,"end":762},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":763,"end":767},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":771,"end":776},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":791,"end":796},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":800,"end":823},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":932,"end":942},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":943,"end":964},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":969,"end":987},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1010},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1011,"end":1018},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1060,"end":1067},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1068,"end":1086},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1114},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1124},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1144},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1145,"end":1165},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R16","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R18","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R19","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R20","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R21","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R22","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"T24"},{"id":"R23","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T24","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R24","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T25"},{"id":"R25","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T27","obj":"T28"},{"id":"R26","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T30","obj":"T29"},{"id":"R27","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T28","obj":"T29"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T1"}]}

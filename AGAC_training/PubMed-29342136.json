Gain-of-function mutations in the 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic II (NT5C2) gene induce resistance to 6-mercaptopurine and are selectively present in relapsed ALL. Yet, the mechanisms involved in NT5C2 mutation-driven clonal evolution during the initiation of leukaemia, disease progression and relapse remain unknown. Here we use a conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity. The loss-of-fitness phenotype of NT5C2+/R367Q mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool. Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts. These results identify the fitness cost of NT5C2 mutation and resistance to chemotherapy as key evolutionary drivers that shape clonal evolution in relapsed ALL and support a role for IMPDH inhibition in the treatment of ALL.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":17,"end":27},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":31,"end":36},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":37,"end":43},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":44,"end":82},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":84,"end":122},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":195,"end":211},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":212,"end":221},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":260,"end":265},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":272,"end":278},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":279,"end":309},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":606,"end":611},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":633,"end":645},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":646,"end":651},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":662,"end":669},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":670,"end":718},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":809,"end":824},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":825,"end":834},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":838,"end":843},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":845,"end":850},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":883,"end":889},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":890,"end":934},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":939,"end":992},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R14","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R15","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R16","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"}]}

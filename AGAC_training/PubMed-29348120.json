Because some studies show an additional association with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), low LDL-C may explain the low risk of IVD in APOC3 loss-of-function heterozygotes. We tested to what extent the low risk of IVD in APOC3 loss-of-function heterozygotes is mediated by low plasma remnant cholesterol and LDL-C.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: In APOC3 loss-of-function heterozygotes versus noncarriers, we first determined remnant cholesterol and LDL-C levels in meta-analyses of 137\u2009895 individuals. Second, we determined whether the association with LDL-C was masked by lipid-lowering therapy. Finally, using mediation analysis, we determined the fraction of the low risk of IVD and ischemic heart disease mediated by remnant cholesterol and LDL-C. In meta-analyses, remnant cholesterol was 43% lower (95% confidence interval, 40%-47%), and LDL-C was 4% lower (1%-6%) in loss-of-function heterozygotes (n=776) versus noncarriers. In the general population, LDL-C was 3% lower in loss-of-function heterozygotes versus noncarriers, 4% lower when correcting for lipid-lowering therapy, and 3% lower in untreated individuals (P values, 0.06-0.008). Remnant cholesterol mediated 37% of the observed 41% lower risk of IVD and 54% of the observed 36% lower risk of ischemic heart disease; corresponding values mediated by LDL-C were 1% and 2%.\nCONCLUSIONS: The low risk of IVD observed in APOC3 loss-of-function heterozygotes is mainly mediated by the associated low remnant cholesterol and not by low LDL-C. Furthermore, the contribution of LDL-C to IVD risk was not masked by lipid-lowering therapy. This suggests APOC3 and remnant cholesterol as important new targets for reducing cardiovascular risk.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":6,"end":22},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":23,"end":32},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":181,"end":197},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":198,"end":207},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":211,"end":216},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":232,"end":235},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":236,"end":262},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1716,"end":1721},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1722,"end":1738},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1790,"end":1793},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1794,"end":1813},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R13","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T20"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"T20"}]}

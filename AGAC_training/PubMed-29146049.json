We performed targeted resequencing of TBK1 in 1253 early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) patients from 8 European countries to investigate whether pathogenic TBK1 mutations are enriched among patients with clinical diagnosis of EOAD. Variant frequencies were compared against 2117 origin-matched controls. We identified only 1 LoF mutation (p.Thr79del) in a patient clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and a positive family history of ALS. We did not observe enrichment of rare variants in EOAD patients compared to controls, nor of rare variants affecting NF\u03baB induction. Of 3 common coding variants, rs7486100 showed evidence of association (OR 1.46 [95% CI 1.13-1.9]; p-value 0.01). Homozygous carriers of the risk allele showed reduced expression of TBK1 (p-value 0.03). Our findings are not indicative of a significant role for TBK1 mutations in EOAD. The association between common variants in TBK1, disease risk and reduced TBK1 expression warrants follow-up in FTD/ALS cohorts.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":16,"end":20},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":21,"end":29},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":30,"end":32},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":33,"end":62},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":108,"end":112},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":114,"end":130},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":137,"end":146},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":166,"end":189},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":200,"end":229},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"}]}

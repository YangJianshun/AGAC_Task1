Here, we demonstrate that, in contrast to MLL-rearranged leukemia, DOT1L plays a protective role in ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced melanoma development. Specifically, the DOT1L gene is located in a frequently deleted region and undergoes somatic mutation in human melanoma. Specific mutations functionally compromise DOT1L methyltransferase enzyme activity leading to reduced H3K79 methylation. Importantly, in the absence of DOT1L, UVR-induced DNA damage is inefficiently repaired, so that DOT1L loss promotes melanoma development in mice after exposure to UVR. Mechanistically, DOT1L facilitates DNA damage repair, with DOT1L-methylated H3K79 involvement in binding and recruiting XPC to the DNA damage site for nucleotide excision repair (NER). This study indicates that DOT1L plays a protective role in UVR-induced melanomagenesis.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":351,"end":356},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":463,"end":472},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":486,"end":496},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":497,"end":502},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":503,"end":527},"obj":"Enzyme"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":528,"end":536},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":548,"end":555},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":556,"end":561},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":562,"end":573},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":671,"end":676},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":677,"end":681},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":682,"end":690},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":691,"end":711},"obj":"CPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T12"}]}

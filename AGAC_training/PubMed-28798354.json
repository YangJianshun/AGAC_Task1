Klotho is a well-known anti-aging factor that regulates phosphate metabolism: mice mutant or deficient in Klotho exhibit phenotypes resembling human aging. Here we show that ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (Enpp1) is required for Klotho expression under phosphate overload conditions. Loss-of-function Enpp1 (ttw/ttw) mice under phosphate overload conditions exhibited phenotypes resembling human aging and Klotho mutants, such as short life span, arteriosclerosis and osteoporosis, with elevated serum 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. Enpp1 (ttw/ttw) mice also exhibited significantly reduced renal Klotho expression under phosphate overload conditions, and aging phenotypes in these mice were rescued by Klotho overexpression, a low vitamin D diet or vitamin D receptor knockout. These findings indicate that Enpp1 plays a crucial role in regulating aging via Klotho expression under phosphate overload conditions.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":466,"end":482},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":483,"end":488},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":540,"end":549},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":629,"end":645},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":650,"end":662},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":669,"end":677},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":678,"end":702},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"}]}

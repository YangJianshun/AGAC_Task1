They both had broad foreheads, hypertelorism, megalocorneas, thick eyebrows with synophrys, flat malar regions, broad and bulbous noses, and mild prognathism. Both had glaucoma, younger one also had cataracts and phthisis bulbi. Other findings included bilateral partial cutaneous syndactyly of 2nd and 3rd fingers, history of impacted teeth with dentigerous cyst in the elder one, and intellectual disability (mild and borderline). The sisters were considered to have Elsahy-Waters syndrome. In order to elucidate the underlying molecular cause, sisters and their healthy parents were genotyped by SNP arrays, followed by homozygosity mapping. Homozygous regions were further analyzed by exome sequencing in one affected individual. A homozygous indel variant segregating with the condition was detected in CDH11 (c.1116_1117delinsGATCATCAG, p.(Ile372MetfsTer9)), which was then validated by using Sanger sequencing. CDH11 encodes cadherin 11 (osteo-cadherin) that regulates cell-cell adhesion, cell polarization and migration, as well as osteogenic differentiation. Further experiments revealed that CDH11 expression was decreased in patient-derived fibroblasts as compared to the heterozygous parent and another healthy donor. Immunostaining showed absence of the protein expression in patient fibroblasts. In addition, cell proliferation rate was slow and osteogenic differentiation potential was delayed. We consider that this study reveals loss-of-function mutations in CDH11 as a probable cause of this phenotype. Next generation sequencing in further patients would both prove this gene as causative, and finely delineate this clinical spectrum further contributing in identification of other possibly involved gene(s).","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":0,"end":25},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":29,"end":34},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":51,"end":56},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":60,"end":82},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1526,"end":1549},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1554,"end":1558},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1599},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1604,"end":1611},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1666,"end":1675},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1679,"end":1684},"obj":"Gene"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T14"}]}

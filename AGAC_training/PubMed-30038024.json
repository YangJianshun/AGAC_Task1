In \u03b2-cells it transports zinc into insulin-containing secretory granules. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in SLC30A8 protect against type 2 diabetes in humans. In this study, we generated a knockin mouse model carrying one of the most common human LOF mutations for SLC30A8, R138X. The R138X mice had normal body weight, glucose tolerance, and pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass. Interestingly, in hyperglycemic conditions induced by the insulin receptor antagonist S961, the R138X mice showed a 50% increase in insulin secretion. This effect was not associated with enhanced \u03b2-cell proliferation or mass. Our data suggest that the SLC30A8 R138X LOF mutation may exert beneficial effects on glucose metabolism by increasing the capacity of \u03b2-cells to secrete insulin under hyperglycemic conditions.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":25,"end":32},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":39,"end":55},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":56,"end":64},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":70,"end":79},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":80,"end":106},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":676,"end":681},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":700,"end":708},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":712,"end":729},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":832,"end":839},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":846,"end":849},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":850,"end":858},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":869,"end":887},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":891,"end":909},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":913,"end":923},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":951,"end":966},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R12","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T16"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T14"}]}

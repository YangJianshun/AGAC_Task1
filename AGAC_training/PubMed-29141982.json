Recently, a novel partial loss-of-function AKT2 coding variant (p.Pro50Thr) was identified that is nearly specific to Finns (frequency 1.1%), with the low-frequency allele associated with an increase in fasting plasma insulin level and risk of type 2 diabetes. The effects of the p.Pro50Thr AKT2 variant (p.P50T/AKT2) on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (GU) in the whole body and in different tissues have not previously been investigated. We identified carriers (N = 20) and matched noncarriers (N = 25) for this allele in the population-based Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM)study and invited these individuals back for positron emission tomography study with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. When we compared p.P50T/AKT2 carriers to noncarriers, we found a 39.4% reduction in whole-body GU (P = 0.006) and a 55.6% increase in the rate of endogenous glucose production (P = 0.038). We found significant reductions in GU in multiple tissues-skeletal muscle (36.4%), liver (16.1%), brown adipose (29.7%), and bone marrow (32.9%)-and increases of 16.8-19.1% in seven tested brain regions. These data demonstrate that the p.P50T substitution of AKT2 influences insulin-mediated GU in multiple insulin-sensitive tissues and may explain, at least in part, the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in p.P50T/AKT2 carriers.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":10,"end":26},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":27,"end":34},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":38,"end":42},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":62,"end":69},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":70,"end":101},"obj":"CPA"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1465,"end":1471},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1488,"end":1492},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1493,"end":1503},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1504,"end":1523},"obj":"MPA"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"}]}

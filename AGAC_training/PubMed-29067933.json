Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) protect against oxidative stress, inflammation, and genotoxicity. Polymorphisms in the GST genes may lead to an imbalance in pro- and antioxidant systems resulting in the increased production of reactive oxygen species that could influence the pathogenesis of psoriasis.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between GSTs (GSTM1 and GSTT1) gene polymorphism in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis as a factor in the susceptibility and development of psoriasis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 128 patients with psoriasis and 250 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood by the phenol chloroform method. The null GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes were identified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.\nRESULTS: The null genotype of GSTM1 and GSTT1 was seen in 45.3% and 40.6% in psoriasis patients whereas in the controls it was 34.4% and 20.0%, respectively. A significant association was seen between the null alleles of the GSTT1 (OR = 2.74) and GSTM1 (OR = 1.58) alone or in combination with tobacco use (P \u003C 0.001) and psoriasis risk. The presence of both null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 further increased the risk of psoriasis (OR = 3.52) when compared with the positive genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1.\nLIMITATIONS: A major limitation of this study was the small sample size. A large epidemiological study is necessary to confirm these findings.\nCONCLUSIONS: The null genotype of GSTT1 is a strong predisposing factor for psoriasis in North India.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":381,"end":394},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":402,"end":405},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":416,"end":423},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":427,"end":468},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":486,"end":495},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":496,"end":533},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":545,"end":554},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":575,"end":584},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1440,"end":1448},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1475,"end":1480},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1485,"end":1490},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1499,"end":1508},"obj":"PosReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1530},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R10","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R11","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T4","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R5","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R8","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R9","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"}]}

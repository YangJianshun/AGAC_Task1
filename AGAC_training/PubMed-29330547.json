FS is typically lethal in the fetal or neonatal period. Inheritance is presumed autosomal recessive. Although no major genetic cause has been identified for FS, biallelic truncating variants in PIGN, encoding a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis pathway, have been identified in a limited number of cases with a phenotype compatible with FS. Biallelic variants in PIGN, typically missense or compound missense with truncating, also cause multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 1 (MCAHS1). Here we report six further patients with FS with or without congenital diaphragmatic hernia and recessive loss of function PIGN alleles, including an intragenic deletion with a likely founder effect in La R\u00e9union and other Indian Ocean islands. Our results support the hypothesis that a spectrum of phenotypic severity is associated with recessive PIGN variants, ranging from FS at the extreme end, caused by complete loss of function, to MCAHS1, in which some residual PIGN function may remain. Our data add FS resulting from PIGN variants to the catalog of inherited GPI deficiencies caused by the disruption of the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":27,"end":31},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":65,"end":73},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":556,"end":585},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":589,"end":593},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":697,"end":707},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":770,"end":772},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":796,"end":800},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":812,"end":820},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":824,"end":841},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":847,"end":857},"obj":"MPA"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":864,"end":869},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":870,"end":929},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T10","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R2","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R3","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T7"},{"id":"R7","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T7","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R8","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R9","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T10"}]}
